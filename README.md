# Password Strength Checker
---
## Objective
  A simple yet effective Python tool to help users verify the strength of their passwords and check if they have appeared in known data breaches using the Have I Been Pwned API.
--- 
## Overview
- This script performs two essential tasks:
  - Evaluates Password Strength
    It verifies if a password meets widely accepted security standards, such as length, character variety, and the use of special symbols.
  - Checks for Data Breach Exposure
    It securely checks whether the password has been compromised in any known data breaches, leveraging the Pwned Passwords service provided by Have I Been Pwned.
## Attachment
   This project documentation comes with the accompanying script in python language.
---
## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Internet connection for accessing the Have I Been Pwned API
---
## Features
- Strength Analysis
  - Minimum length requirement
  - Presence of uppercase letters
  - Presence of lowercase letters
  - Inclusion of numerical digits
  - Inclusion of special characters
- Breach Verification
  - Securely checks password leaks using the HIBP API
  - Implements the recommended k-anonymity approach, ensuring user privacy
  - Provides clear feedback on breach status
## Installation
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone <repo_url>
   cd <repo_folder>
2. Install Dependencies
   The script uses re and hashlib (both standard Python libraries) and requests (an external package).
   Install requests using pip if not already installed: 
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```
---
## Usage
   Run the script via the terminal:
   ```bash
   python pswd_checker.py
   ```
---
## Working
This script uses the Have I Been Pwned API's k-anonymity method to ensure security and privacy:

- The password is hashed locally using SHA-1.
- Only the first five characters of the hash are sent to the API.
- The API returns all hashes with that prefix.
- The script compares the suffix locally to determine if there is a match.

At no point is your actual password or full hash transmitted over the internet.
---
## Notice
- Always use unique passwords for different services.
- Even if your password is not currently listed in a breach, there is no guarantee it is entirely secure.
- This tool is intended for personal and educational use only. Follow your organizationâ€™s password management policies for production systems.
